    Change the left value of the day of week.
    1 is sunday, 2 is monday, and so on.

1: prepare your arduino by uploading DS3231Setup.ino to your arduino
    (This will allow the arduino to communicate with your PC)
2: Run SendTime.bat, this will send the time to the arduino
3: Check if the time is correct by writing "B," (no quotes) to the arduinos serial monitor. It should print out the clocks synced time.
