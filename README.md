 Stuff thats just there
 
 or stuff that I made just for lols

# fun facts
This repo helped me when I was using IntelliJ Idea (for context: java was the first language I was messing around in this repo and i started off with ECLIPSE IDE) for a few minutes or so when it deleted my entire java directory. 
the root folder was there, but all of the shit in it was not.
might have been my fault for being a dumbass but tbh its kinda both mine and IntelliJ's fault ig

## and ANOTHER FUN FACT
this repo used to be a drag n drop repo where I would just drag my original coding workspace folder to this repo whenever i felt like it. its was entirely scuffed and eventually i switched to a more gooder version of doing this.
