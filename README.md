 Stuff thats just there

This repo helped me when I was using IntelliJ Idea for a few minutes or so when it deleted my entire playground (java) directory. 
the root folder was there, but all of the shit in it was not.
might have been my fault for being a dumbass but tbh its kinda both mine and IntelliJ's fault ig
